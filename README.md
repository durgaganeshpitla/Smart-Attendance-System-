Smart Attendance System Using Face Recognition This is a complete Face Recognition based Attendance System built using Python and OpenCV. It captures face images, trains a face recognizer, recognizes students in real-time through webcam, logs attendance automatically, and can send attendance reports via email.  Table of Contents Project Overview  Technologies and Libraries Used  Folder Structure  How to Run the Project  Step-by-Step Usage  Features  Troubleshooting  Project Overview This project automates the attendance marking process using facial recognition technology. Students' faces are captured and stored, then used to train a recognition model. When running the recognition, the webcam detects and identifies faces, marking attendance with timestamps, and saving reports as CSV files. Attendance reports can be emailed automatically.  Technologies and Libraries Used Python 3.x  OpenCV (opencv-contrib-python for face recognition modules)  NumPy – array manipulations  Pandas – data handling (CSV files)  Yagmail – sending emails via SMTP (Gmail)  PIL (Pillow) – image processing  Threading – background tasks for training and monitoring  Haar Cascade XML – face detection model (haarcascade_default.xml)  Folder Structure text Smart-Attendance-System-master/ │ ├── Code/ │   ├── app.py                    # Main program with menu │   ├── capture_image.py          # Face image capture logic │   ├── train_image.py            # Train face recognizer │   ├── recognize.py             # Recognize faces & mark attendance │   ├── check_camera.py           # Camera test utility │   ├── automail.py               # Email attendance reports │   ├── haarcascade_default.xml   # Face detection model │   ├── TrainingImage/            # Captured face images stored here │   ├── TrainingImageLabel/       # Trained model saved here (Trainner.yml) │   ├── StudentDetails/           # Student info CSV: StudentDetails.csv │   ├── Attendance/               # Attendance CSV reports generated here │   ├── readme.md                 # This file │ ├── Documentation/                # Optional your reports, PDFs etc. How to Run the Project Prerequisites Python 3.x installed on your system.  Install required Python packages:  bash pip install opencv-contrib-python numpy pandas pillow yagmail Gmail Account Setup for Auto Mail:  Enable 2-Step Verification on your Gmail.  Create an App Password for mail sending.  Replace email and app password in automail.py.  Running the Program Open terminal/command prompt.  Navigate to the Code directory.  Run the main program:  bash python app.py Use the menu options to interact with the system.  Step-by-Step Usage Option	Description 1	Check Camera – Verify your webcam works and faces are detected. 2	Capture Faces – Capture and save student face images with ID/name. 3	Train Images – Train the face recognizer with captured images. 4	Recognize & Attendance – Real-time recognition, mark & save attendance. 5	Auto Mail – Email the latest attendance CSV file to a specified recipient. 6	Quit – Exit the application. Features Real-time face detection and recognition with OpenCV.  Face image data capture and organized storage.  Training of LBPH face recognizer model.  Automatic attendance marking with ID, Name, Date, and Time.  Saving attendance reports as CSV files in a dedicated folder.  Sending attendance CSV files automatically by email.  Graceful menu-based user interface.  Troubleshooting No faces detected while capturing: Ensure good lighting and that the camera works properly.  Training fails or no model file generated: Confirm images exist in TrainingImage and that opencv-contrib-python is installed.  Empty attendance CSV: Make sure recognition is successful by confirming faces are detected in option 4.  Email sending errors:  Use Gmail App Password, not regular password.  Double-check credentials and internet connection.  Folders missing: Create required folders manually (Attendance, TrainingImageLabel etc.) before running.  Important Notes Always run option 2 (Capture Faces) and option 3 (Train Images) before attempting recognition.  Make sure StudentDetails/StudentDetails.csv has proper student IDs and names.  The face recognition accuracy depends on quality and quantity of captured images.  To secure your email credentials, do not share automail.py with real passwords publicly.# Smart-Attendance-System-
